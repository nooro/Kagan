Main Character spawns in the game with no memories of his past ... and no idea where he is ...

He starts exploring and finds people to interact with

Hints that he is in a game ... illustated as dialogue ... character thoughts ... cinematics ... memories
... loading screens 

Plot :

He starts geting involved in the ingame affairs ... Which leads to the first endings where he 
finds out he is in a game and decides to stay to help them regardless of that they are just some
NPCs 

Cool textures to illustrate the matrix of the game... for example when game load its like the character floats in the 
code of the game... (Pictures of the game code that look cool and show some hints that he is in a game like a name of a 
function or an object)

Second ending he just leaves the game 

(Dilema between chosing to stay and finish the game and just leave it and save himself)
(the dilema must be both about the character(player) in the game and the user so he wont just choose 
to help the npcs cuz of more gameplay ) 
(if the user decides to stay, the character may be stuck there and 
the user never completes the game, (the character never gets out of the game 
(which the user thinks is the goal of the game))) 
This way the user will have the dilema of picking between (or atleast thats what he thinks) completing the game 
(character leave the game) and staying (this way helping the npc-s) but not completing the game

In a way he have to chose ... Complete the game that our character is stuck in or complete the game the user is playing

Idea : if the user finds out earlier he is in a game add a cheat so he can leave the game early 
and this way skipping some stuff or sth like that ... maybe different story ... 3rd plot or just mash up 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When he dies it gives a hint of how he isnt from this world or something like that

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Good character development so its obvious he isnt just a normal character 
and npc-s look like the usual standart and boring code with no life in them
(its a hint that he isnt from the game and he is a normal human ... players wont give much though to it)

finds a character which is more 'alive' than the others (leaves a hint that he sees sth different about her or him)

Hints may be illustrated as character thoughts ... (and ofcourse breaking the 4th wall for the realism of his character)

In his thought remembering abouts stuff from his own time which they dont have in the games' world
